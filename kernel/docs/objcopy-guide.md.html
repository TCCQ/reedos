# Objcopy
This page collects useful information for `objcopy`.

Unless you are changing the build process significantly, this is likely not something you will need. Are you looking for `objdump` instead?

`objcopy` is a gnu program from manipulating compiled object files which also includes the `ELF` format we are using as a final executable at the moment. Most of this info was pulled from the man page.

Recall that you will likely need to invoke this program as something like:
```
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy
```

## Usage
The most basic usage is
```
$ objcopy inputFile.o outputFile.o
```
This is simply a copy as one might expect. The most basic useful usage is
```
$ objcopy inputFile.o -O ELF outputFile.ELF
```
Which converts the object to an `ELF` format. You can also specify the input file format with `-I` although it is often not necessary.

`objcopy` can also be use to strip symbols from object files or change their types but so far that has not been necessary for this project. The `man 1 objcopy` page has all the useful information for this program.
