# nm
This page collects useful information about `nm`, the gnu program to list symbols from object files.

The functionality of `nm` is a subset of the functionality of `objdump`, so that guide is likely more in-depth.

Recall that you will likely need to invoke this program as something like:
```
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-nm
```

## Invoking
Likely all you will need is
```
riscv...nm reedos.ELF
```
However it is highly recommended to pipe the output into `grep` or something like it so you don't have to scroll through several hundred to thousands of lines of symbols.

## Interpreting Output
`nm` produces one symbol per line, with the 'value' (location) on the left in hex, the metadata about said symbol, and the name in that order.

Metadata characters you might be interested in:

A
: Absolute, value will not change by linking
B/b
: BSS, this data is likely uninitialized or zero initialized
D/d
: Data, this data is initialized in the data section
G/g
: This data is in a special section for small bits of initialized data
I
: Indirect, this symbol is an indirect reference to another symbol
N
: This is a debugging symbol
R/r/n
: Read, this symbol is in the read-only data section
S/s
: Small, this symbol is in a small section for uninitialized small objects
T/t
: Text, this symbol is in the text section and likely points to code
U
: Undefined, this symbol is undefined and will likely cause a linking error unless linked with another object file that defines this symbol
V/v
: this symbol is weak, and will defer to non-weak symbols with the same name at link time, or be zero without error
W/w
: Weak, this symbol is weak but has not be explicitly tagged as such.
?
: this symbol is an unknown type
